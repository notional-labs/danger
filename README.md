# Danger Zone

It is dangerous, and so is $danger.

this is a live fire mainnet, whose purpose it is to be attacked by anyone who wants to, for research purposes.  


## Sane default research

We've allowed default settings in cosmos to get insane, but we don't know which and how.  Danger will launch entirely with default settings, like a 100 block signed block window.  Validators are responsible for changing this. 


## Genesis procedure

* Star the repository
* Make a tweet announcing somehting along the lines of "Validatorname will validate danger and facilitate security research in cosmos.  Anyone can contact us to run tests or report danger.  We're committed to keeping information about danger inside the validator set until the danger has been resolved by fixes to the wider cosmos."
* Be in the Danger twitter DM group
* Give youself a billion udanger in genesis
* Make the usual pull request
